Decision Analysis & Risk Optimization â€“ QBUS3330 Assignment

This project applies decision analysis and sensitivity modeling techniques to real-world business scenarios using tools such as Excel and Precision Tree. It forms part of the coursework for QBUS3330: Advanced Business Analytics at the University of Sydney.

Project Overview

This individual assignment involves three key business decision scenarios:

Question 1: Drug Testing Policy Decision for AIS
- Developed decision tree models to evaluate whether the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) should mandate drug testing for athletes.
- Modeled uncertainties (false positives/negatives) and costs/benefits using Bayesian updates and payoff tables.
- Conducted decision analysis with Precision Tree to recommend optimal policy.

Question 2: Competitive Bidding Strategy for iC
- Modeled a pricing strategy for Intelligent Computing (iC) bidding on a computer supply contract.
- Constructed a payoff matrix based on market probabilities.
- Created decision trees and conducted expected monetary value (EMV) calculations.
- Performed sensitivity analysis on bid preparation cost, supply cost, and market competition.

Question 3: Investment Ranking Under Uncertainty
- Compared three investment options using expected value and risk evaluation.
- Created tables, payoff distributions, and decision trees to visualize and rank investments.
- Addressed preferences of different types of investors (risk-averse, risk-neutral, risk-seeking).

Tools & Skills Applied
- **Precision Tree** for decision modeling and sensitivity analysis
- **Excel** for payoff tables, Bayesian probability calculations, and visualizations
- Decision theory, utility modeling, and risk assessment
- Application of Bayesian inference and Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
- Communication of analytics through business reports


> This project demonstrates applied skills in decision analysis, sensitivity modeling, and business forecasting using advanced Excel-based tools.
